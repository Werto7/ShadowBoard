ShadowBoard 0.30 is a forum software that is specifically designed for the darknet. It stores the data in files instead of in a database. It is designed to work without JavaScript.

The forum software does not work yet, although the installation works somehow. It is still in the early stages of development.

And JavaScript is still there. But that is going to go away.
